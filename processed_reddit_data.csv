How Mark Meadows Became the Least Trusted Man in Washington. The untold story of the rise and fall of Trump’s former chief of staff — and his role in the prosecutions that may determine the 2024 election.,1,1amehno,2024elections,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/magazine/mark-meadows-trump-prosecution.html,0,"On most Monday mornings, Mark Meadows commutes from his home in South Carolina to his workplace in Washington. He flies first class and travels light, moving briskly through Reagan airport, sometimes accompanied by his wife, Debbie, or by weekend guests, like his close friend and fellow archconservative Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He is then ferried to the Capitol Hill headquarters of the Conservative Partnership Institute, or C.P.I., the nonprofit right-wing hub Meadows joined a week after Donald Trump left office.

Even without the knowledge that his annual salary as a senior partner at C.P.I. is $847,000, and that he purchased his house overlooking Lake Keowee for $1.6 million six months after the Trump administration came to an end, it would be natural to conclude that Meadows, the 64-year-old former White House chief of staff, is doing very well for himself. His public appearances, though far fewer than before — he was spotted at the Capitol in October during Jordan’s unsuccessful campaign to be speaker of the House, for example — reveal the same tactile Southern congeniality that Meadows honed to perfection during his days as a real estate agent in North Carolina. For those who have known Meadows for a long time, including those who harbor a powerful dislike of him, his air of breezy prosperity is not at all incongruent with the crisis that currently looms over him. The Mark Meadows they know has always been a peerless escape artist, ever ascending over the bridges he has burned.

But his familiar guile is now facing its greatest test. In August, a grand jury in Fulton County, Ga., indicted Meadows on charges related to his alleged participation in a racketeering scheme to overturn Georgia’s 2020 presidential election results and keep Trump in office. Two months later, Katherine Faulders of ABC News broke the story that Meadows had been furtively speaking with prosecutors in the federal case being pursued against Trump by the Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith. The possibility that the former president’s closest White House aide — a man with unsurpassed access to Trump during the final months of his presidency — might be seeking to wriggle out of further trouble by supplying damning information to prosecutors, and perhaps even testifying against Trump at trial, suggested a seemingly inescapable choice for Meadows: prison time or career suicide.

As soon as the ABC News story broke, Meadows called his friend Jordan to insist it wasn’t true, according to someone Jordan later told about the conversation. (Through a spokesman, Jordan denied speaking to Meadows about the matter.) Meadows’s attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, publicly disputed the story’s accuracy. Some Trump affiliates suggested to me that Meadows had merely gotten by with the minimum in complying with a federal subpoena, and that this by itself did not prove he was a rat.
Still, Meadows’s murky status has been a source of consternation in Trump world. Two close associates of the former president acknowledged to me that opinions in that community were sharply divided on the matter of Meadows’s fidelity. Another Trump confidant conveyed to me the suspicion that Meadows was wearing a wire. In addressing the possibility that his former chief of staff had cut a deal to avoid a prison sentence, Trump confessed uncertainty about the matter on his social media platform, Truth Social, in a way that was most unlike him, posting on Oct. 24: “Some people would make that deal, but they are weaklings and cowards, and so bad for the future our Failing Nation. I don’t think that Mark Meadows is one of them, but who really knows?”

Points to ponder: Why do the voters have to deal with the election fraud accusations from Trump again? The Iowa Caucus already stated in the news article, ""*you must be a legal resident of Iowa and the precinct you live in and bring photo ID with you to participate.*"" That makes the election fraud accusations false. Why is a presidential candidate with 91 criminal offenses being elected to the office of the Presidency? This whole election does not make sense. Trump gets away with all his con and scams.

A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting via private secret ballot.*  *A caucus,* *however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer and arguing for others to join them.

[Presidential primaries and caucuses | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/primaries-caucuses) *""Primaries and caucuses are two ways that people help states and political parties choose presidential nominees.

* [How do the Iowa Caucuses work? (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWd7swa_EV0) \- More points to ponder:  If the caucus require all people to be in one room, wouldn't there be a voter registration check before they enter? If the person is from out of Iowa, then the registration check will know from the address that the voter is an outsider and that voter cannot enter the room.  If not, then why do caucuses let their election be prone to fraud from outsiders? In-person votes are less prone to fraud. The voter who is verified for registration is actually in the room voting. The only voting fraud in person is when the voters who do not care who wins are paid by someone to vote for a candidate.  For example, Voter John pays Voter Jane $100 to vote for Candidate X. Since the Republican caucus use secret ballots, they are prone to fraud than the Democratic caucus where they vote by joining the group for the selected candidate. The Democratic caucus physically votes with their bodies. Everyone can see their votes.

Biden scores major union backing as its leaders attack Trump | CNN Politics,63,1cc33mi,JoeBiden,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/politics/biden-building-trades-union-endorsement/index.html,2,"In making one of their earliest ever presidential endorsements, North America’s Building Trades Unions(NABTU) leaders are kickstarting an eight-figure organizing program to try to deliver their 250,000 members in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin for Biden.

The Teamsters, whose endorsement is being pursued by both Biden and Donald Trump, are members of NABTU but abstained from Tuesday’s board vote, according to people briefed on the proceedings. They will endorse after the Republican and Democratic conventions.

The backing from NABTU, which has 3 million members nationwide, is more enthusiastic than its 2020 backing of Biden. And it comes at a moment when a significant slice of union rank-and-file has split from traditionally Democratic-aligned union leadership in ways that are reverberating through elections. That’s raised questions about the political future of the next generation of union members.

Biden will appear at the union’s conference in Washington on Wednesday to officially get the nod – which union leaders also want to be seen as a stark rebuff of Trump, who eagerly solicited support from union members and leaders during his time in office, but, their leaders say, didn’t deliver. NABTU had called for Trump to resign after the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

The outreach programs the union will now fund will hit hundreds of thousands of members and their families in the blue wall states that Biden flipped from Trump in 2020 and that will be crucial to 2024, connecting members through their local union halls, social circles and at home.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the White House meeting with Abigail and her family was “a reminder of the work still to do” to win the release of dozens of people who were taken captive by Hamas in an Oct. 7 attack on Israel and are still believed to be in captivity in Gaza.

Abigail, who has dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship, was taken hostage after her parents were killed in the attack and was released nearly seven weeks later. She was the first U.S. hostage freed by Hamas as part of a deal with Israel to exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners early in the war. Abigail turned four during her time in captivity.

Israel says the militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others.

Biden’s meeting with Abigail came as Hamas on Wednesday released a recorded video of an Israeli American still being held by the group.

The video was the first sign of life of Hersh Goldberg-Polin since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It was not clear when the video was taken.

Goldberg-Polin, 23, was at the Tribe of Nova music festival when Hamas launched its attack from nearby Gaza.

Biden Makes $11 Billion Push to Beat China at Chip Research,36,1cc5g6u,JoeBiden,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/biden-makes-11-billion-push-to-beat-china-at-chip-research,1,"The Biden administration’s efforts to revitalize the chip industry have mostly focused on doling out multibillion-dollar grants for domestic factories. But there’s a less-discussed side to the push: turning cutting-edge semiconductor research into a more enticing field for Americans.

As part of the 2022 Chips and Science Act, the Commerce Department is spending $11 billion to boost US leadership in research and development. The hope is to create the next generation of critical electronic components, and beat Beijing in the battle for advanced technology. That will involve everything from developing better measurement techniques for microelectronic materials to new strategies for what’s known as chip packaging — fitting the components together for use.

Money from the Chips Act helped fund the NSTC and a program focused on advanced packaging. The roots of this R&D push predate the pandemic, and it’s separate from $39 billion in production incentives for companies like Intel Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Those grants are just the first step toward keeping America’s chip economy healthy, said Daniel Berger, associate director of Commerce’s packaging effort. “The R&D program, which I’m part of, is to sustain it, keep it here,” he said.

The department has already funded some initial projects focused on metrology, or the science of measurement. Officials plan to create a piloting facility to transition new packaging technologies to large-scale production, plus programs for workforce development. There also will be a $200 million manufacturing institute focused on digital twinning — the creation of virtual models of physical components. They’ll open funding applications for that institute in the near future, a Commerce official said.",2024-04-25T02:18:38,biden make billion push beat china chip research biden administration effort revitalize chip industry mostly focused doling multibillion dollar grant domestic factory le discussed side push turning cutting edge semiconductor research enticing field american part chip science act commerce department spending billion boost u leadership research development hope create next generation critical electronic component beat beijing battle advanced technology involve everything developing better measurement technique microelectronic material new strategy known chip packaging fitting component together use money chip act helped fund nstc program focused advanced packaging root r push predate pandemic separate billion production incentive company like intel corp taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co grant first step toward keeping america chip economy healthy said daniel berger associate director commerce packaging effort r program part sustain keep said department already funded initial project focused metrology science measurement official plan create piloting facility transition new packaging technology large scale production plus program workforce development also million manufacturing institute focused digital twinning creation virtual model physical component open funding application institute near future commerce official said,0.9842,Positive,Biden,"{'trump': {'negative': 0.02023966, 'neutral': 0.08429721, 'positive': 0.8954631}, 'biden': {'negative': 0.02060642, 'neutral': 0.08512816, 'positive': 0.8942655}}"

He also noted that April is Second Chance Month and marked it by reaffirming his commitment to rehabilitation and reentry programs and building a criminal justice system that “ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law.”

Biden in December 2023 commuted the sentences of 11 individuals serving jail sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and signed a proclamation to pardon certain marijuana offenses.

The final rule also trims sodium in kids’ meals, although not by the 30% first proposed in 2023. And it continues to allow flavored milks — such as chocolate milk — with less sugar, rather than adopting an option that would have offered only unflavored milk to the youngest kids.

The limits on added sugars would be required in the 2025-2026 school year, starting with high-sugar foods such as cereal, yogurt and flavored milk.

A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the Biden administration has asked the Qatari government several times for assistance in getting proof-of-life for Goldberg-Polin and other American hostages.

The issue has come up in phone calls between Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as senior White House officials.

A U.S. official said the Biden administration received the video on Monday. ""We've been in touch with the family since that time and the FBI and Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell are actively examining the video,"" the U.S. official said.

The video of Goldberg-Polin will increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to Hamas' demands for a hostage deal.

For the Qataris, securing the proof-of-life — especially for an American citizen — is an important political achievement that signals to both the U.S. and Israel that they can deliver as mediators.

The FTC projected the rule could reduce health care costs by up to $194 billion in the next decade. It has cited evidence that noncompete agreements encourage consolidation and drive up health care prices.

On January 1, the threshold would rise further to $58,656, covering another 3 million workers.

The new standard fulfills one of President Biden’s signature objectives of raising the wages of low- and middle-class Americans and it comes within months of his face-off with former President Donald Trump in the November election. For years, Biden and Democrats in Congress have proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour but have been blocked by Republican lawmakers.

Biden leans on one-time battleground Florida as a cautionary tale,115,1cb3unx,JoeBiden,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/23/biden-florida-abortion-ban-00153745,6,"President Joe Biden probably won’t carry Florida in November. But he hopes the state serves as a warning to voters elsewhere about what could happen if he doesn’t win.

Biden plans to denounce Florida’s policies, especially a six-week abortion ban taking effect next week, during a campaign event in Tampa on Tuesday. It’s just one example of how the campaign in the coming months will try to designate the now conservative-leaning state as “ground zero for Trump’s MAGA blueprint,” citing not just abortion but also looser gun laws and book removals from school libraries.

Biden knows he has to spend time in Florida to show how “extreme” conditions have gotten in the state under DeSantis, said state Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried. “He understands that if we’re going to fight back against the extremism of the MAGA Republicans, that you got to come to the belly of the beast,” Fried said.

The Biden campaign made the surprising declaration this month that it saw Florida as “winnable,” after the state Supreme Court authorized a referendum that would allow voters to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, thereby undoing the six-week ban.

The high-stakes legal showdown comes three years after President Joseph Biden signed an executive order encouraging the FTC to limit non-compete agreements, which affect roughly one in five Americans.

The antitrust and consumer protection agency is expected to publicly release the text of its final rule Tuesday afternoon before debating and voting on it in an open meeting of the FTC’s five commissioners. The Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, told reporters it plans to sue over the rule as soon as Wednesday.

The FTC first proposed a non-compete ban in January 2023, arguing the restrictions unfairly block workers from switching jobs and undermine labor competition.

The threat depends on the outcome of the 2024 election. If Donald Trump and the Republicans sweep back into power, they would have the ability to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a 1996 law that allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules through a streamlined process. Unlike most legislation, CRA resolutions can pass with a simple majority in the Senate, giving a future Republican majority a path to quickly show progress early in 2025.

But because of the timeline outlined in the CRA, any rule finalized before late May (roughly speaking; this is a moving target) is safe from being reversed by Congress.

It was actually surprising to me to see George Floyd of all things triggered protests after years of seeing so much worse; the beating of Ehud Halevy, the murder Daniel Shaver, shootings of law abiding gun owners, and countless deaths caused by raiding the wrong home. After the protests and riots of 2021 there was a lot of talk about finding solutions to the problem, whether that was retraining or abolishing them entirely... But as far as I can tell, little has changed from the point of view of the average person.

There is a growing recognition among Biden’s top political advisers that the president could benefit from taking a positive step on immigration to contrast with his tough talk on the issue, and with an expected executive order aiming to sharply curb illegal crossings at the southern border. 

Officials inside the White House and at the Department of Homeland Security have been studying a range of proposals to provide work permits or deportation relief for millions of undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the U.S. for a long time. They have zeroed in on the population of mixed-status families, where typically the children and one parent are U.S. citizens, because they believe that demographic is the most compelling, according to administration officials and advocates who have spoken with them.

Though the announcement of a program isn’t imminent, officials say, the White House has discussed timing it before the election as a sort of one-two punch following an executive order that would likely upset immigration advocates

Several advocates who have spoken with the president believe he supports the proposal and views the idea as his chance to make an impact similar to President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

My mom mentioned the elation she felt in seeing ""the media"" proven wrong in 2016. It was a sense of contrarianism that appealed to her. For my parents, and I strongly suspect a large segment of Trump voters, his (seeming) contrarianism is a big part of his appeal and you can hear that if you listen to Trump's speech. Even when he is appealing to ""traditional values"" he is doing so as a form of contrarianism. If you are reading this and have any say in Biden's marketing campaign, please find a way of defining Trump as an ""establishment"" figure -- that, I truly believe, could have an impact. Thanks!

They will be the first non-Americans to walk on the moon should their Artemis mission happen before a planned Chinese flight.

NASA said the Japanese contribution to Artemis “will enable astronauts to travel farther and conduct science in geographically diverse areas by serving as a mobile habitat and laboratory for the astronauts to live and work for extended periods of time.” NASA also noted it can “accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days as they traverse the area near the lunar South Pole.” The space agency aims to “use the pressurized rover on Artemis VII and subsequent missions over an approximate 10-year lifespan.”

Japan gets direct access to the technology that will be developed as a result of Artemis, which will have both space and earthly applications. Just as importantly, the country will have bragging rights for having its astronauts walk on the moon.

NASA gets what is in effect a lunar RV, a pressurized vehicle that can take two astronauts on long distances across the moon’s surface, visiting sites at a considerable distance from the landing site. Astronauts can work and live inside the vehicle in shirt sleeves and go outside in space suits to take geological samples and leave experiments.

The EPA’s latest action seeks to enable remediation of historic pollution of two of the most notorious and dangerous types, called PFOA and PFOS.

The new hazardous substance designation gives the agency greater authority to investigate and clean up sites that have been polluted with these chemicals under the nation’s Superfund law. It also makes it easier for the agency to compel the companies that dumped them to pay for those actions. 

The EPA also said that it was issuing a separate policy stating that it would focus these efforts on big polluters like companies that made or used PFAS in manufacturing or certain federal facilities.

The move comes just days after a separate rule established legal limits for several PFAS in drinking water, including PFOA and PFOS.

Participating in the initiative led by the White House’s Office of Gun Violence Prevention will be officials from the FBI and the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development as well as FEMA, AmeriCorps and the Small Business Administration.

President Joe Biden announced the new guns office last fall after his administration had exhausted the executive actions they could take to address the gun violence epidemic. Biden had already signed historic legislation, 2022’s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, as well as more than two dozen orders on guns.

Biden tasked the team with finding new executive actions and implementing the BSCA, which has resulted in the most sweeping expansion of firearms background checks in decades. He also asked the office to coordinate support for survivors, families and communities in the wake of a mass shooting — from emergency trauma care and mental health support to federal assistance for businesses and schools — in the same way FEMA responds to natural disasters.

It was Office of Gun Violence Prevention's deputy director Gregory Jackson's job to create this first-ever federal protocol. He’s tested it out in real time, coordinating across agencies after shootings in Maine, Chicago and Kansas City.

In the immediate aftermath, the Department of Justice will deploy law enforcement and FBI victim services, as it previously has.

Is it possible for President Biden or his family to sue Comer and the others for their endless slander and defamation?,97,1c6k4or,JoeBiden,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/1c6k4or/is_it_possible_for_president_biden_or_his_family/,31,"Curious about the legalities of this situation.

So Republicans, who have so far proven that President Biden has committed no crimes, has never taken a penny from foreign powers, neither has his family... are STILL pushing the known LIE that President Biden somehow took millions from China (despite not only no evidence of it, but their scouring of bank records and other finances have proven it an impossibility... all while the orange traitor was PROVEN to have gotten paid by China and other nations while in office).

Is this not the definition of defamation? They are knowingly lying to the American people, trying to make Biden look bad and turn voters away. Doesn't matter how many times they're PROVEN to be lying (thanks to rockstars like Raskin, Moskowitz and Goldman) they KEEP repeating them. Or just coming up with NEW lies (which are immediately debunked).

I get that there is some protection for politicians with the whole Speech & Debate Clause, but aren't there limits? They've proven there is zero grounds for impeachment. They can't even come up with a supposed crime that happened. Yet they keep going, for the sole purpose of hurting President Biden in 2024.

Same was as Republicans openly admitted that they did their sham investigation of Clinton, knowing there was no crime, and that they would be able to find no evidence... solely to hurt her numbers in the polls. McCarthy even bragged about that fact. That they tanked her support on what they KNEW was a lie, but that Americans were too stupid to see that.",2024-04-18T04:22:01,possible president biden family sue comer others endless slander defamation curious legality situation republican far proven president biden committed crime never taken penny foreign power neither family still pushing known lie president biden somehow took million china despite evidence scouring bank record finance proven impossibility orange traitor proven gotten paid china nation office definition defamation knowingly lying american people trying make biden look bad turn voter away matter many time proven lying thanks rockstars like raskin moskowitz goldman keep repeating coming new lie immediately debunked get protection politician whole speech debate clause limit proven zero ground impeachment even come supposed crime happened yet keep going sole purpose hurting president biden republican openly admitted sham investigation clinton knowing crime would able find evidence solely hurt number poll mccarthy even bragged fact tanked support knew lie american stupid see,-0.9584,Negative,Biden,"{'trump': {'negative': 0.99268556, 'neutral': 0.0033499224, 'positive': 0.003964561}, 'biden': {'negative': 0.9924252, 'neutral': 0.0033831126, 'positive': 0.004191728}}"
Micron Poised to Get Over $6 Billion in Chips Grants in Announcement Next Week,26,1c6qgkm,JoeBiden,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-17/micron-mu-to-get-over-6-billion-in-chips-act-grants-in-announcement-next-week,0,"Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer-memory chips, is poised to get $6.1 billion in grants from the Commerce Department to help pay for domestic factory projects, part of an effort to bring semiconductor production back to American soil.

President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel on April 25 to the Syracuse, New York, region as part of the announcement, the people said. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is building factories near Syracuse, as well as in its home state.

Micron has pledged to build as many as four factories in New York state, plus one in Idaho. But those plans “require Micron to receive the combination of sufficient Chips grants, investment tax credits and local incentives to address the cost difference compared to overseas expansion,” Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said last month. The company is proceeding with projects in China, India and Japan as well.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said that her agency will prioritize funding projects that begin production by the end of the decade. Two of Micron’s four New York sites are on track to meet that benchmark, while the other two won’t be operational until 2041, the company said in a recent federal filing. That means that Micron’s award is likely to support only the first two New York facilities, people familiar with the matter said earlier.",2024-04-18T08:55:00,micron poised get billion chip grant announcement next week micron technology inc largest u maker computer memory chip poised get billion grant commerce department help pay domestic factory project part effort bring semiconductor production back american soil president joe biden scheduled travel april syracuse new york region part announcement people said micron based boise idaho building factory near syracuse well home state micron pledged build many four factory new york state plus one idaho plan require micron receive combination sufficient chip grant investment tax credit local incentive address cost difference compared overseas expansion chief executive officer sanjay mehrotra said last month company proceeding project china india japan well commerce secretary gina raimondo said agency prioritize funding project begin production end decade two micron four new york site track meet benchmark two operational company said recent federal filing mean micron award likely support first two new york facility people familiar matter said earlier,0.9761,Positive,Biden,"{'trump': {'negative': 0.0246845, 'neutral': 0.7983566, 'positive': 0.17695887}, 'biden': {'negative': 0.024276977, 'neutral': 0.76915884, 'positive': 0.20656414}}"

My first choice for POTUS 2024 is AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Katie Porter for VP. 

Why AOC? 5 words: GREEN NEW DEAL CLIMATE ACTION!!! 

Why Katie Porter for VP? The Constitution names the vice president of the United States as the president of the Senate and she would kick ass for the American people. Don’t believe me, watch the videos of Katie Porter’s tough questions, it doesn’t matter who is being questioned: congress, international corporations, or any other witnesses. She’s incredibly tenacious and brilliant.  

If Katie Porter isn’t serving as VP of the United States with POTUS Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – damn I hope she runs for Senate. Katie Porter would be a great replacement for Dianne Feinstein for California. And Dianne could retire knowing someone incredible is in the Senate for the people of California.

On the topic of a simultaneous bid for congress and the White House. #quote Ballotpedia .com “ In most states, a candidate for the presidency cannot simultaneously seek election or reelection to congressional office. However, five states – New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, West Virginia, and Hawaii – permit simultaneous bids for congressional office and the presidency. … BUT, According to Roll Call and the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is unclear whether California's law prohibiting dual candidacies applies to presidential candidates. .” I mention this because I would like to know, American politics, so “interesting”. 

Okay, my 2nd dream team are two unique extremely intelligent individuals, both with solid backgrounds in understanding how US politics works, who have both been keeping a better eye on current events then almost anybody in the US – because they have been fighting for the American people with comedy news for decades. Jon Stewart for POTUS and Stephen Colbert as VP. Damn, the Stewart/Colbert team would be awesome. I would love, love, love listening to them on the “real” news for eight years. Also, the Colbert/Stewart team work just as well. 

P.s. I would like to Amber Ruffin to temporarily fill in for Colbert on the Daily show for 8 years. No, Colbert doesn’t get to retire from The Late Show until he’s at least as old as David Letterman when he retired from Late-Night, Dave was 72 by the way. Anyway, such a nice dream President Stewart and VP Colbert.

P.s…ps. Amber Ruffin is the funniest host on TV right now IMO. 

My 3rd hypothetical dream team is Beto O'Rourke for POTUS with Bernie Sanders as VP. 

Just ponder that team for a minute. Sincere Beto and wise Bernie, the sincere and wise combo could do America a lot of good.

After the alternative-facts and non-reader, capitol riot and the pandemic, haven’t we have been through enough? 

Again, The Constitution names the vice president of the United States as the president of the Senate and who would be better for the American people serving as VP than Bernie Sanders? Nobody has more experience than Bernie. It would be a great last lap of his carrier, 8 years as VP. And we need his progressive movement to finally find a secure nest. Beto as a team lead, a.k.a. POTUS, Bernie’s long held ideals could translate them through Beto’s reasonable rambles, …Quote, 

Reasonable people can disagree... and it makes them no less American.

– Beto O'Rourke

Bernie’s progressive movement moderated via Beto could work for all of us. 

All of these teams would work for the majority of Americans, the economy to climate change. 

Please don’t make us suffer through another Hillary run. 

And most importantly, any candidates who do run in the primaries. Could you please agree to work as at team for the American people, not fight against each other. America can’t take another divorce, the divide is actually killing us.

The sting from Al Gore v. W. Bush still lingers for Gen-X and older, voting for a 3rd party candidate in a presidential election without ranked choice voting equals the majority loses.

2016 by the official count speaks for the majority's loss again this time by 2,868,686 votes for H.R.C.

Ranking the top 10 non-Biden Democrat candidates by how much black voter appeal they have,7,vw9gi7,2024Election,https://www.reddit.com/r/2024Election/comments/vw9gi7/ranking_the_top_10_nonbiden_democrat_candidates/,13,"The top 10 after Biden is pulled from predictit: Newsom, Harris, Buttigieg, Hillary, Bernie, Abrams, Klobuchar, Warren, AOC, Brown

Black voters was THE key to winning the primary for Hillary and Biden.

This is kind of an attempt to measure how strong their black support is vs overall support, rather than their overall strength.

1. Stacey Abrams - Abrams has become a well known activist/political figure who black voters would likely be familiar with. Her personality seems like it could someone they know more than Harris imo.

2. Kamala Harris - Harris didn't do so well with black voters in the primary as her personality doesn't jive with them the best, but her name recognition is higher now and is attached to Biden who does well with black voters.

3. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - AOC is a minority and she has a celebrity factor that gives her an advantage over white candidates who they don't know who they are. Her socialist views might turn off some conservative black voters. I feel like she's the type of latina that black guys hit on, not sure if that helps or hurt.

4. Hillary Clinton - Hillary did great with black voters in 2016 as the Clintons have roots with them. You can argue for her as high as 1 here.

5. Gavin Newsom - This is where it drops off into the candidates who are white and not Hillary. I have the black community as favoring a bit more masculinity (without the scandals I'd have said Cuomo was someone who could have clicked with them) and Newsom has that a bit more than someone like Buttigieg. He also should have more name recognition compared to Brown.

6. Sherrod Brown - Brown seems like a pretty standard white male candidate in terms of the black vote, but at least he is a straight male and hasn't proven he was weak with them in previous primary.

7. Bernie Sanders - Sanders has some celebrity and views that could have appeal, but the black vote has cost him the last two primaries, I think jewish people don't play well in black community. 

8. Elizabeth Warren - I don't think black community will be supporting many white women, but she is a bit more famous than the next one

9. Amy Klobuchar - You could claim they could respect her toughness, but I suspect the name recognition in black community just isn't that high

10. Pete Buttigieg - Buttigieg is one of the whitest people ever even before considering that it seems like homosexual candidates are likely to be less popular with black community. He is DOA with them.

Michelle would be first if she ran obviously

Edit - He is not on predictit but some people are starting to list North Carolina governor Roy Cooper as a candidate. I would put him 5th on this list for potential appeal to black voters as he won governor in a state with top 10 black population. He looks like a president imo and speaks like a left wing GW Bush.

DEMS CAN WIN IN NOVEMBER especially now that the Supreme Court has shown its ugly face and is removing fundamental rights for strictly ""religious"" bigoted reasons. Charlie Crist leads desantis in FL by 1 point. Beto can beat Abbott in texas and Dems can pick up 3 senate seats and hold the bouse despite corrupt gerrymandering/cheating. They keys to this are:

we UNITE UNITE FROM LEFT TO CENTER RIGHT and vote 100% democrat no matter who the candidate is or what your pet peeves are. So centrists eagerly vote for leftists and vice versa, even Joe Manchin types get the leftist votes because the alternative is much worse. United the non rightwing cannot be beaten statewide.

Ukraine gives Putin another bad bloody nose and forces him to sue for peace or cease fire, even a stand-off draw would drop oil prices by a lot. Inflation would then drop to net zero with wages up 5%. That takes away the cynical ""Biden is to blame for inflation"" lie of the rightwing. Actually Putin, gas gougers and trump tariffs are now to blame for 90% of inflation.

January 6th and other scandals continue to drop bad headlines and criminal charges onto leading Republicans. I hope the DOJ is on top of Desantis and his Russian agent press manager for instance, and his former righthand man Matt Gaetz. Trump himself needs to get indicted and convicted and all this needs to happen soon.

I think Cotton and Cruz maybe are somewhere in the middle, they're not really treated as one of their own by MAGA, but they have more respect for them than people like Graham and Romney.

Cruz is probably too unlikeable, but Cotton could emerge as someone trying to merge the two sides of the party. I can see him running against Trump in the primary more than DeSantis, and when it comes down to them he could appeal to people who are scared of Trump losing against in the general, and believe all they need is someone normal/boring in a good way. At the same time the former Trump voters wouldn't be totally against it and could buy into that he'll have a spine standing up to the leftists.

To me, its like choosing to support one half of a dumpster fire, or the other. When we really should be figuring out how to put it out. So please, do not mistake this analysis for approval of anyone. Im just a historian.

First, if Trump decides to run, there is no one else in the Republican party that could possibly defeat him in the primary. Unless a shooting star breaks out in the next couple years, I don't see how any currently have a chance.

The economy over the next couple years, is going to be rough. Decades of pillaging and bad decisions are coming to a head, on top of discontent, inflation, a housing, stock and other money (crypto, nft) that really don't make a lot of sense.

Biden wasn't exactly popular in the first place, and neither is Kamala. Let's face it, they won because of votes against Trump, and not votes for them. Historically those types of candidates do not do well. They do not excite people. 

So, with the shaky situation we will be in economically, and the potential match up.. I would say it heavily favors Trump.

Can Harris pull off a GHW Bush? The majority pattern says no.,3,jv6ezh,2024Election,https://www.reddit.com/r/2024Election/comments/jv6ezh/can_harris_pull_off_a_ghw_bush_the_majority/,7,"I don't think Biden will run for a second term. He will be 78 by the time of his inauguration, and 82 when his first term finishes, and if he ran again, he'd be 86 at the end of his second term.

So, as Harris is the VP, she is in the strongest position to become the Democratic nominee in 2024.

But to win, she would have to pull off a GHW Bush--that is, successfully win an election of the incumbent party (the most recent example of an incumbent party retaining the Whitehouse).

It's pretty easy for an incumbent to win re-election, but it is very difficult for the President to pass the Whitehouse on to someone from the same party.

Since WW2, an incumbent of the same party has won 3 times (FDR --> Truman; JFK --> LBJ; Reagan --> GHWB). Whereas, over the same time period, the Whitehouse has flipped 9 times, from Republican to Democrat and back to Republican.

Truman (D) succeeded FDR's (D) four terms, but then didn't run a second time. Eisenhower (R) had two terms after Truman; then JFK (D), and one full term of LBJ (D); then two terms of Nixon (R); Ford (R) loses, and Carter (D) wins one term. Then Reagan's (R) two terms followed by one from Bush Sr (R). Then Clinton (D) for two, Bush (R) for two, Obama (D) for two.

Americans elect a presidential candidate hoping for something new that they thought they were going to get from the past president, but didn't. The President gets into power, and, more-or-less runs the same playbook expected of their party.

As the first or second term of a president comes to an end, two new candidates emerge from the Primary Thunderdome. Then, tired of feeling disappointed by lackluster results of the party they previously elected, the incumbent party's voters fail to show up ""for the third term"", giving the win back to previous loser party.

If Harris wants to be president, she needs to push Biden to be the next FDR. She needs a highly successful Biden presidency that she can wave to Democratic voters & left-leaning Independents such that they will not feel unenthused to vote for her in 2024.",2020-11-16T21:05:29,harris pull ghw bush majority pattern say think biden run second term time inauguration first term finish ran end second term harris vp strongest position become democratic nominee win would pull ghw bush successfully win election incumbent party recent example incumbent party retaining whitehouse pretty easy incumbent win election difficult president pas whitehouse someone party since ww incumbent party time fdr truman jfk lbj reagan ghwb whereas time period whitehouse flipped time republican democrat back republican truman succeeded fdr four term run second time eisenhower r two term truman jfk one full term lbj two term nixon r ford r loses carter win one term reagan r two term followed one bush sr r clinton two bush r two obama two american elect presidential candidate hoping something new thought going get past president president get power le run playbook expected party first second term president come end two new candidate emerge primary thunderdome tired feeling disappointed lackluster result party previously elected incumbent party voter fail show third term giving win back previous loser party harris want president need push biden next fdr need highly successful biden presidency wave democratic voter left leaning independent feel unenthused vote,0.9932,Positive,Biden,"{'trump': {'negative': 0.16811553, 'neutral': 0.5424744, 'positive': 0.28941002}, 'biden': {'negative': 0.17969933, 'neutral': 0.51216114, 'positive': 0.3081396}}"
